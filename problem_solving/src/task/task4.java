	/*Problem Description!

Elavenil has a chessboard with N rows and M columns.
 In one step, he can choose two cells of the 
 chessboard which share a common edge 
 (that has not been cut yet) and cut this edge.

Formally, the chessboard is split into
 two or more pieces if it is possible to 
 partition its cells into two non-empty 
 subsets S1 and S2 (SnS2=, |51|+|52|=NM)
  such that there is no pair of cells

cl,c2 (c1E51,c2â‚¬52) which share a common edge
 that has not been cut.

Elavenil does not want the board to split into two or more pieces.

Compute the maximum number of steps he can perform while satisfying this condition.

Constraints:

TSN,Ms8

Input Format:

The only line of input test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.

Output Format

In the only line of output print an integer representing the maximum possible number of steps*/
